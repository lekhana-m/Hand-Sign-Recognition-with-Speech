This is a robust system to recognise the hand gestures used by deaf and hearing-impaired people. It acts as a bridge between them and others. Hand Gesture recognition system provides us an innovative, natural,user friendly way of communication with the computer which is more familiar to the human beings. By considering in mind the similarities of human hand shape with four fingers and one thumb, the software aims to present a real time system for recognition of hand gesture on basis of detection of some shape-based features like orientation, Centre of mass centroid, fingers status, thumb in positions of raised or folded fingers of hand.

The system takes the hand gestures as input through the web cam sends it to model. The model recognizes the gesture and displays the alphabet , then converts it to speech.
